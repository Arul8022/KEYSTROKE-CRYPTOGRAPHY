Keylogging: A Serious Cyber Threat Cybercriminals have devised numerous methods to carry out malicious activities on users' systems or networks, often with the goal of stealing sensitive information or personal data. Cybercriminals and hackers frequently use keylogging apps or software to steal passwords and confidential information. Keystroke logging, also known as keylogging, records keystrokes entered on a keyboard. Passwords, PINs, credit card numbers, confidential texts, and other information can be recorded and retrieved by a cybercriminal when typed on the keyboard of a compromised computer. Keylogging can be used by hackers for all kinds of criminal purposes. Hackers can easily gain access to banking accounts, email accounts, and other login credentials by stealing passwords and locking out the legitimate owners. The information they obtain can be used to steal money and blackmail the owner. It can also be done by someone known to the victim to deceive friends, colleagues at work, and family members. The hacker can use this information as part of identity theft schemes to blackmail the owner for profit.

 Keystroke logging is an activity monitoring program that records the keys pressed on a keyboard and mouse clicks, saving them to a log file. It can be easily used to obtain sensitive data like PINs, passwords, bank details, and other credential information without the user's knowledge and transmit it to malicious attackers. It can be a major threat because we cannot easily identify the presence of keyloggers on our systems, as they run in the background and often do not appear in the task manager in Windows operating systems.

 The revolutionary capabilities of the Internet have changed how we share files and information, send emails, and exchange messages. Advances in technology have had a large influence on our lives. The Internet has become a multidisciplinary tool. More than 40 percent of the world’s population is connected to the Internet, according to internetlivestats.com. Cybercriminals commit malicious activities to capture confidential information from users' systems without necessarily cracking into users' databases or file servers. Malware, also known as malicious software, is any code or program written by hackers with the intent to cause damage to a system without the user's consent. There are various types of malware, such as viruses, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, rootkits, and botnets. They harm computer systems or networks by performing various functions, like monitoring users' activity without their consent, deleting and hiding sensitive data, and stealing data. 

A keylogger is a type of malware, specifically a rootkit, that records users' activity without their knowledge. Keyloggers can record everything you do on your computer. Modern keyloggers are highly sophisticated and increasingly difficult to detect by antivirus programs and anti-malware tools. 
Keylogger detection and prevention is a challenging task for security managers. Unlike traditional viruses and worms, advanced keyloggers are present, which are nearly impossible to detect. A keylogger is basically a specific type of spyware that can record everything you type on your keyboard. Although it is a common tool for corporations—the information technology departments of corporations use keylogging software for troubleshooting purposes or to monitor employees' suspicious activity—the major concern about keyloggers arises when a third party is involved. 

When a third party compromises our computer system, we often do not know what type of keylogger it is, and it can steal any password we have entered, periodically take screenshots, record the web pages we have viewed, capture any instant messaging sessions, sent emails, and confidential financial information, and then send all that data to the third party.

 The sent data can be used by third parties for criminal purposes. Keyloggers are mainly categorized into two major categories: hardware keyloggers and software keyloggers. Hardware keyloggers are easy to use, as they are placed within the internal hardware of the computer itself, or they can be secretly inserted between the CPU and the keyboard wire. However, to install a hardware keylogger, the cybercriminal needs to have physical access to the computer system while no one is watching. Unlike hardware keyloggers, software keyloggers can be easily introduced onto a victim’s system. That is the main reason why software keyloggers are much more common.


 They do not harm the hardware of the system, but they are definitely a threat to both business and personal activities. Before delving into the study of keylogging, we should have knowledge of keyboard functioning and how keyboards interface with other components.
